# EKN-Project - Crime and COVID-19 in the KC Metro Area
# This study takes place from October 2019 to December 2020. In this branch we collected crime and coronavirus data from APIs and unemployment data from governmental sources.
# Questions pertaining to crime:
   # 1) Did COVID-19 impact crime in KCMO?
   # 2) What were the trends in crime at this time?
   # 3) Was an increase in crime correlated to an increase in unemployment?
# Data Steps:
   # 1) Research and evaluate sources of data.
   # 2) Gather data.
   # 3) Cleanse and reformat data using pandas.
   # 4) Analyze and visualize trends in data with matplotlib.
   # 5) Merge components to gain visibility in any overarching trends.
# Limitations:
   # 1) Time and resources.
   # 2) Data sources - i.e., crime data limited as agencies don't always publish the data. Crime data was sparse until October 2020 so results are likely skewed.
# Results/Conclusions:
   # 1) COVID-19 may have caused an increase in crime in KCMO, but the data is inconclusive due to the large gaps from inconsistent reporting. Despite this, crime shows a strong, positive correlation between COVID-19. Correlation coefficient at 0.91 and r-squared of 0.82 between cases and crime incidents. There lies a similar relationship between coronavirus deaths and crimes in the Kansas City area.
   # 2)  Thefts and sexual offenses decreased pre-to-post COVID-19 outbreak, while (theft from/of vehicle), assault, robbery, property crime, quality of life, breaking & entering, and homicide incidents increased.
   # 3) Unemployment and crime were negatively correlated during the entire timeframe of this study. However, if we only look at October-December 2020, both values increase at the same time. Again, this goes back to the quality of the crime data so results are inconclusive.
